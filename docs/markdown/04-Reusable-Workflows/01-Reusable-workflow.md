# Reusable Workflows
## Avoid duplication

- Since November 2021
- Reference an entire workflow
- Composite != Reusable Workflows
- Canâ€™t reference a reusable workflow thatâ€™s in a private repository
- A **Caller** is a workflow that uses a reusable workflow
- A reusable workflow canâ€™t be caller of another reusable workflow
- Many reusable workflows in a caller

```yaml

jobs:
  call-workflow-1-in-local-repo:
    uses: octo-org/this-repo/.github/workflows/workflow-1.yml@main
    
  call-workflow-2-in-local-repo:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/workflow-2.yml
    
  call-workflow-in-another-repo:
    uses: octo-org/another-repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@v1
 
 ```

```yaml

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      image_name:
        required: true
        type: string
      tag:

    secrets:
      registry_username:
