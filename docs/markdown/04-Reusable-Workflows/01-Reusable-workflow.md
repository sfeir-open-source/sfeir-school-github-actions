# Reusable Workflows
## Avoid duplication

- Since November 2021
- Reference an entire workflow
- Allow to reuse and share workflow
- Composite != Reusable Workflows
- A **Caller** is a workflow that uses a reusable workflow

```yaml[]

jobs:
  call-workflow-1-in-local-repo:
    uses: octo-org/this-repo/.github/workflows/workflow-1.yml@main
    
  call-workflow-2-in-local-repo:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/workflow-2.yml
    
  call-workflow-in-another-repo: # need public repo or specific setting if private
    uses: octo-org/another-repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@v1
 ```

- 4 levels of nested workflows
  - caller-workflow â†’ called-workflow-1 â†’ called-workflow-2 â†’ called-workflow-3
- Max 20 reusable workflows in a caller
- env context not propagated
- use variables to share between
- Allow inputs and secrets sharing

```yaml[]
name: Create and Publish Docker Image

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      image_name:
        required: true
        type: string
      tag: 
        type: string
    secrets:
      registry_username:
        required: true
