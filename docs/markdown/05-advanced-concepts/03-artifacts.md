# Artifacts

"*Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed.*"

* Uploading files: 
  * use `upload-artifact` action

* Downloading files: 
  * use `download-artifact` action
  * use UI.
  * use API

<br/><br/>

* retention period
  * 90 days for public / max 400 days for private


Notes:

Use caching when you want to reuse files that don't change often between jobs or workflow runs, such as build dependencies from a package management system.
Use artifacts when you want to save files produced by a job to view after a workflow run has ended, such as built binaries or build logs.
